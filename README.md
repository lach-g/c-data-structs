# My Basic Data Structures in C

## About

I wanted to define a common set of data structures that would be handy in any project. This is a start


## TODOs

- [ ] Fix inline todos
- [X] Look at just header file implementations
- [ ] Larger test suite for each data structure
- [ ] Doxygen-style comments
